The goal is to understand how different parts of the code interact with each other. Instead of relying on AI to generate complete code solutions, the goal is to use AI and other learning resources to grasp key concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and build the code independently. This approach helps develop a strong foundation in programming by focusing on how various components work together rather than just obtaining the final answer.
